    "#### Answer\n",
    "To calculate the probability that the number drawn from the hat is a perfect square, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes (slips of paper with a perfect square number) and the total number of possible outcomes (slips of paper with any number between 1 and 20).\n",

    "The favorable outcomes are the perfect square numbers: 1, 4, 9, and 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of slips of paper, which is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n",
    "\n",
